# 🧮 sagecalculus

**A collection of interactive SageMath notebooks for exploring foundational topics in calculus and symbolic mathematics.**

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains step-by-step notebooks demonstrating how to use **SageMath** for solving problems in **calculus**, including:

- Limits and continuity  
- Derivatives and differentiation techniques  
- Integrals and antiderivatives  
- Series and approximations  
- Symbolic manipulation and simplification

Each notebook is self-contained and written for learners with basic calculus knowledge, aiming to show the power of computer algebra systems in mathematical exploration.

## 📁 Contents

- `Maths_in_Sage.ipynb`: Introductory notebook — symbolic computation, limits, basic derivatives  
- `Maths_in_Sage_2.ipynb`: Advanced derivatives, higher-order calculus, plotting  
- `Maths_in_Sage_3.ipynb`: Integrals, series expansions, and additional symbolic techniques

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the notebooks:

1. Install **SageMath**: https://www.sagemath.org/download.html  
2. Launch the SageMath Jupyter environment:
   ```bash
   sage -n jupyter
   ```
3. Open the `.ipynb` files and run the cells interactively.

Alternatively, try them online using **CoCalc**: https://cocalc.com/

## 🧠 Why SageMath?

SageMath is a free, open-source mathematics system combining the power of many existing tools (like Maxima, SymPy, and NumPy). It's ideal for symbolic math, and these notebooks show how SageMath can complement traditional calculus learning.
